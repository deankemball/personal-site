### is a media artist specialising in graphics and visual effects.

this can be anything from **photography**, produced **video**, real-time **visuals**, **motion graphics**, **illustration**, and more recently **video games**.

he has produced *music videos*, *video installations*, *audio-reactive visuals* for both live-streams and for musical-performances, and more.

it is **my goal** to learn programming in order **to combine these skills** into a more concise product.
